# This file is reserved for UI resources, such as icons.
# For PySide6, resources are typically compiled from a .qrc file.

# Example of how to create a .qrc file:
# <!DOCTYPE RCC><RCC version="1.0>
# <qresource prefix=/icons>
#   <file alias="app_icon.png>"images/app_icon.png</file>
# </qresource>
# </RCC>

# To compile it, run:
# pyside6-rcc resources.qrc -o resources.py

# For now, this file can remain empty.
